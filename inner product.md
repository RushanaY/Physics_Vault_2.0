Generally speaking it is a function, that takes in two vectors and gives a scalar. In the case of the Cartesian coordinates we also call it the dot or scalar product. Some of it's properties are linearity, symmetry and positive definiteness
Any vector space that has this function has therefore a norm. If this space also is complete, this space is called the [[Hilbert space]].
